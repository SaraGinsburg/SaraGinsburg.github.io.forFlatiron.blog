hi, 

So this was a long road, and I am finally writing the blog for this project.

What prompted me to do this project is really life - driven. I have seen kids fight alot, tell-tale about each other, "he did this to me", "he said that I am...." , etc.

I was looking to reverse this relationship. Let them report about nice things that friends and siblings said and did to them... and let them gain points for telling nice things about their siblings and friends.

Also, included in this project is a Milestone tracker , for children and parents  to record milestones in the child's  life, along with a short description and pictures.

The interesting part of working on this project is, that in the beginning I worked and studied, and did not see this 'coming together',  but then, slowly as you trek ahead, and solve one issue, and then another, it becomes easier. 

What fueled me while going ahead, was the feeling that all of a sudden, these tools are more easily at my disposal and just like with a new acquired language, I can express myself more comfotably. Another thing that really propelled me forward, was the 'big picture', the idea behind this project.
And, yes, I would like to see families reversing the trend of siblings rivalry, perhaps  this app can help....

Lastly, I am pleased to  say that the instructors for this part of the course, Howard and Annable, were really very good, both in well explaining the material and by making themselves available for guidance.

thank you for a very nice experience,
