The content of your blog post goes here.

hi, 
so I am not up to my final project yet.
but I would like to take notes of things that I am learning as I encounter them.

So, a few words about Actions:

Actions are plain JavaScript objects.
They must have a type property.

the type should typically be defined as a string constant.

Here is an example of an action :  {type:  ADD_CANDY
                                   text: 'the more the merrier'
																	 }
