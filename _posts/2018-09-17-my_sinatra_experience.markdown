I enjoy the process of learning via learn.co, it is gradual and thorough.

The labs all seem relatively easy and there is available support. And then, when you have to do it on your own, you find out that yes, you do have the skill and knowledge.. even though it was a gradual and a non painful learning road.

My Sinatra project involves a tool that is quite practical for me.

It is called todo tasks.

there are users that have projects and projects that have tasks.

Once my project was finished, I was sitting with my son, (he is a user) and we discussed many life projects that he can work on, and then we added the tasks. Each task has a name and a description, which lends itself to brainstorming the different possibilities and items that the task involves.

For myself, as a user, I chose different renovation projects, and actually got to the tasks planning phase for each renovation project.
This proved to be a useful tool for me, as well.

I wanted to share something small that I have come across today and might benefit others as well:

There is a difference between a checkbox option in an erb form and a radio button.

Whereas a checkbox would allow the user to select multiple options, the radio box would allow one option exclusively.

This  is useful when a user is  looking to add a new task. The user is presented with all his projects, and is asked to choose the project to which he would like to add a task. The use of Radio buttons, allowed for selecting one project at a time, to which a task can be added.

I hope to gain speed, without compromising the thoroughness, as I move forwards  in the program.
