HTML is the a language for creating Web pages.

HTML describes the structure of Web pages.

HTML elements are represented by tags, that label parts of the page such as "heading", "paragraph", "list", etc.

HTML tags are surrounded by brackets <>, and they normally  come in pairs like <p> and </p>, where the first tag marks thes start and the second tag is the end tag.

The end tag is written like the start tag, but with a forward slash inserted before the tag name
